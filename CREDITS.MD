## Acknowledgements

- Thank you to GitHub users @RGK13 and @fougerec for helping test the system for initial release.
- Thank you to the Foundry VTT creators and community. There was no way to know that a VTT and its community could enrich my life, but it truly has in many unexpected ways.
- Thank you to the [FVTT CyberpunkRED - Core](https://gitlab.com/cyberpunk-red-team/fvtt-cyberpunk-red-core) team and community. I learned to code through my work on that project and wouldn't be where I am without the kindness of many devs including Zyzyx, Masque and Twiglet. Much of this project's code and organization was inspired by our work there.
- Thank you to TheLastScrub and his work on [Delta Green for Foundry](https://github.com/TheLastScrub/delta-green-foundry-vtt-system-unofficial). He allowed me to become a co-author on that project, and some of that code inspired this project's code.
- Thanks to Marvel for endless amounts of entertainment and inspiration.
