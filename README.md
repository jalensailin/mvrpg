# Info for Testers

## Disclaimer

This system is still a work in-progress. This README page is intended for people who wish to test the system out for me, but it is not yet ready for the general public to use in their home games. This page will be updated with a better README when that time comes.

### Install Instructions

- Open Foundry and navigate to the **Systems** tab.
- Click "Install System" at the top of this tab.
- Navigate to the bottom of the Install System window, and you will see a text-box labeled "Manifest URL"
- Paste the following link into that text-box and press the "Install" button.
  - Manifest Link: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jalensailin/mvrpg/main/system.json>

### Update Instructions

- Typically, you can update via the normal Foundry path, i.e. clicking the 'circle-arrows' button in the bottom-left corner of the MV RPG's system card, under the Game Systems tab.
  - This will only work, however, if I remembered to increment the version number in `system.json` along with my most recent changes.
  - If you see that I have made changes to the system, and the normal update path isn't working, instead, simply uninstall and reinstall the system from the above link.

### Using Github

1. Go to [Github](https://github.com) and make an account if you do not already have one.
2. Navigate to the [project page](https://github.com/jalensailin/mvrpg), also called the repository or 'repo':
3. There you will find multiple sections across the top of repo, the most important section for you is the "Issues" section.
4. Whenever you find a bug or other issue, create an Issue for it in the Issues tab.
   - Give the issue a descriptive title
   - Expand on your issue in the Description.
   - Descriptions should include the following:
     - Steps to reproduce the issue.
     - **Screenshots** (not copy/paste) of any errors in the console (f12) encountered during the issue.
     - Further details on what makes this an issue (describe the bug, rules issue, style issue, expected behavior, etc.).
     - For example, "The rules from the book work like ABC but in the system it currently works like XYZ. I think its possible you misinterpreted that rule. To see what I mean, try the following steps..."
   - Submit your issue and I will give it appropriate labels/priority for tracking purposes.
   - I will respond to the issue with my thoughts, expectations, ideas for solving it, etc.
   - Once issues have been solved in a satisfactory way, or otherwise deemed not-relevant, they will be closed and we will be one step closer to initial release ðŸ˜€.

### Testing The System

- Download the system and make a new world.
- Press F12 to open the console and keep it open while you test. Make note of any errors you encounter.
- Play around with the system's offerings: Make an Actor, make Items, roll some dice, try it with Dice So Nice and see how that works, etc.
- See what is easy to use, see what is difficult to use, what's obvious, what isn't.
- Feel free to ask me questions or request clarifications via Discord.
- Report anything that seems like a potential issue on the [Github project page](https://github.com/jalensailin/mvrpg).
  - Please feel free to raise an issue about anything, but understand that the goal here is to get an initial release, so people can start playing soon. In that vein, I will sort Issues by priority.
  - High priority:
    - Game-breaking bugs
    - Support for game rules which are currently missing and are required for smoothly playing the game, or are otherwise incorrect.
    - Simple feature requests that greatly improve quality-of-life and are easy to implement.
  - Medium priority:
    - Minor bugs that don't impact gameplay
    - Support for rules that help smooth out gameplay or track certain things, but aren't strictly necessary and wouldn't take a lot of work to implement
  - Low Priority:
    - Fancy feature requests that may require a lot of work and/or aren't really necessary for an initial release.
    - Support for rules that are pretty easy to track manually and/or would take a long time to implement.
- Things that are currently missing/incomplete
  - Combat tab
  - Team Maneuvers
  - Making it obvious to a layperson what properties can be modified with Active Effects
  - Combat vs Non-combat rolls (currently there is no distinction)
  - I'm sure there are a bunch of other things that you will hopefully help me identify
